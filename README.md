# GameManager
SpriteKit, Swift, Singleton &amp; NSUserDefaults (Example)

Example of using a singleton to manage game data and *NSUserDefaults* to provide data storage.

The *GameManager* high score is displayed on screen, any touch will increase the high score.  
Send the app to the background, kill it and relaunch to see the new high score restored.

Uses the handy [SwiftyUserDefaults](https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults) to make NSUserDefaults Swifty :)
